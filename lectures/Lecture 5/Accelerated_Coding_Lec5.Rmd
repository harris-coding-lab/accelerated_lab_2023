## Today's lesson

- Conceptual goal: How does a data visualization communicate about the underlying data?

- Coding goal: How do we tell the computer how to make the plot
  
  
  - How to map data to aesthetics with `aes()` 
  - How to visualize the mappings with `geom`s 
  - How to get more out of your data by using multiple aesthetics
  - How to use facets to add dimensionality


*We have entire courses on data visualization. This is just a sample.*


# How have annual housing sales in Texas changed over time?
  

## "Look at the data"

```{r, echo = FALSE}
 annual_sales <- 
  txhousing |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(total_volume = sum(volume, na.rm = TRUE))

annual_sales |>
  head(10)
```

        
## What if we make a plot of annual housing sales over time...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# prepare new data frame 'annual_sales':
# sum up monthly volume to get annual volume
 annual_sales <- 
  txhousing |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(total_volume = sum(volume, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(data = annual_sales,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = total_volume)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Total volume of sales in Texas")
```


#  How do we tell the computer how to plot from the underlying data?


## A "grammar of graphics" \footnotesize (Wickham 2010, Wilkinson et. al 2005, Bertin 1983)

  - Grammar = "the whole system and structure of a language"

  - i.e a set of rules for how to combine information in order to communicate

<!--Discuss how each layer displays particular information
1. we have a pattern
2. then we contextualize the pattern with scales and labels
3. finally we add a title that explains the point -- data usually don't speak for themselves
-->
![](./images/grammar_idea.png)


## `ggplot` code structure

```{r eval=FALSE}
# layer 1
ggplot(data = dataset,
       mapping = aes(x = x_variable,
                     y = y_variable)) + 
# layer 2
  geom_<type of plot>() +
# layer 3
  labs(x = "x name", y = "y name")
```



## Basic Components of `ggplot` (Layers)

<!-- TODO is there a better way to explain this?-->

- Layer 1:  `ggplot()`

  - bring in data
  - how data are mapped to visual information, the "aesthetic mapping"

- Layer 2: `geom_xxx()`

  - say how to visualize the aesthetic mapping -- bars, dots, etc.

- Layer 3: `labs()`

  - communicate main point + what the aesthetics represent
  - title, legend, axes-labels, etc
  



##  An "aesthetic" is a visual property of the objects in your plot

- We *map* data to aesthetics
  
  - `col1` will be represented by color
  - `col2` will be represented by the x-position

\medskip

##  `ggplot()` tells R to prepare to make a plot.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Let's prepare new data frame 'annual_sales'
annual_sales <- 
  txhousing |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(total_volume = sum(volume, na.rm = TRUE))
```



```{r}
# Layer 1, data frame
ggplot(data = annual_sales)
```

## Layer 1: adding an aesthetic `mapping`
\footnotesize
`mapping = aes()` declares how to map the data to "aesthetics":

  - map each row of the data (`year`, `total_volume`) to the (`x`,`y`) 
  - automatically picks scale for axes

```{r}
ggplot(data = annual_sales,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = total_volume)) 
```

## Layer 2: visualizing the mapping with `geom_point()`

\footnotesize
- Each *observation* or row has a (`year`, `total_volume`) mapped to the coordinate pair (`x`,`y`)


```{r}
ggplot(data = annual_sales,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = total_volume)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Layer 2: visualizing the mapping with `geom_col()`
\footnotesize
- Each *observation* or row has a (`year`, `total_volume`) mapped to the coordinate pair (`x`,`y`)

```{r}
ggplot(data = annual_sales,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = total_volume)) +
  geom_col()  
```


## Layer 2: visualizing the mapping with `geom_line`
\footnotesize
Here we see a line connecting each (`x`,`y`) pair using `geom_line()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = annual_sales,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = total_volume)) +
  geom_line()
```

## Layer 2:  visualizing the mapping with `geom`
\footnotesize
The data can be visualized with different `geoms` that can be composed (`+`) together:

```{r}
ggplot(data = annual_sales,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = total_volume)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```


## Layer 3: Adding labels makes the plot more readable:
\footnotesize
```{r}
ggplot(data = annual_sales,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = total_volume)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Annual Volume", 
       title = "Annual Sales in Texas") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # center the title
```


## Over laying multiple `geoms`: adding vertical lines

\footnotesize
```{r}
annual_sales |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = total_volume)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 2007),
                   linetype = "dotted")
```

- add horizontal lines with `geom_hline()`
- add any linear fit with `geom_abline()` by providing a slope and intercept




## aesthetics beyond the `x` and `y`  position 
\footnotesize
We'll use `midwest` data and start with only mapping to `x` and `y`

```{r}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
              y = percbelowpoverty)) +
      geom_point()
```

## `ggplot()`: Using `color`
\footnotesize

- `color` maps data to the color of points or lines
  - Each `state` is assigned a color
  - This works with discrete data and continuous data

```{r}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
              y = percbelowpoverty, 
              color = state)) +
      geom_point()
```

## `ggplot()`: Using `shape`
\footnotesize
- `shape` maps data to the shape of points
  - Each `state` is assigned a shape
  - This works with discrete data only

```{r}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
              y = percbelowpoverty,  
              shape = state)) +
      geom_point()
```

## `ggplot()`: Using `color` + `shape`
\footnotesize
- Combining `color` and `shape`:
  - Each `state` is assigned a shape and color

```{r}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
              y = percbelowpoverty,  
              color = state,
              shape = state)) +
      geom_point()
```

## `ggplot()`: Using `alpha`
\footnotesize
- `alpha` maps data to the transparency of points
- we map the percentage of people within a known poverty status to `alpha`

```{r}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
              y = percbelowpoverty, 
              alpha = poptotal)) +
      geom_point()
```

## `ggplot()`: Using `size`
\footnotesize
- `size` maps data to the size of points and width of lines.
- we map the percentage of people within a known poverty status to `size`

```{r}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
              y = percbelowpoverty, 
              size = poptotal)) +
      geom_point()
```

## `ggplot()`: Using multiple aesthetics together
\footnotesize
We can combine any and all aesthetics, and even map the same variable to multiple aesthetics

```{r, eval = FALSE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
              y = percbelowpoverty, 
              alpha = percpovertyknown,
              size = poptotal,
              color = state)) +
      geom_point()
```

## `ggplot()`: Using multiple aesthetics together

```{r, echo = FALSE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
              y = percbelowpoverty, 
              alpha = percpovertyknown,
              size = poptotal,
              color = state)) +
      geom_point()
```

## Facets: a tool to explore multidimensional data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = log(poptotal), 
              y = percbelowpoverty)) +
      geom_point() +
      facet_grid(vars(state))
```

## Facets: a tool to explore multidimensional data
```{r, echo = FALSE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = log(poptotal), 
              y = percbelowpoverty)) +
      geom_point() +
      facet_grid(vars(state))
```


## Facets: a tool to explore multidimensional data
```{r}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = log(poptotal), 
              y = percbelowpoverty)) +
      geom_point() +
      facet_wrap(vars(state))
```

## `ggplot()`: Using aesthetics to explore data
\footnotesize
Different `geoms` have specific aesthetics that go with them. 

 - the ggplot cheat sheet shows all the `geom`s with their associated aesthetics

## Try it yourself: Plot 1
\footnotesize
1. Adjust code to reproduce the following plot (sample codes provided in the next slide):


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# answer
midwest |>
  ggplot(aes(x = perchsd, 
             y = percollege)) +
  geom_point()
```
        
## Try it yourself: Plot 1
```{r, eval = FALSE}
midwest |>
  ggplot(aes(x = ?, 
             y = ?,
            )) + 
  geom_?()
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# answer
midwest |>
  ggplot(aes(x = perchsd, 
             y = percollege)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Try it yourself: Plot 2
\footnotesize
2. Adjust code to reproduce the following plot (sample codes provided in the next slide):

  ![](./images/10_5.png){width=95% height=95%}

## Try it yourself: Plot 2
```{r, eval = FALSE}
midwest |>
  ggplot(aes(x = ?, 
             y = ?, 
             color = state,
             size = ?, 
             alpha = percpovertyknown)) + 
  geom_?() +
  facet_wrap(vars(?)) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# answer
midwest |>
  ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
             y = percbelowpoverty, 
             color = state,
             size = poptotal, 
             alpha = percpovertyknown)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(state)) 
```

## Write your own labels with `labs()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
midwest |>
  ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
             y = percbelowpoverty,
             alpha = percpovertyknown)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "County-level poverty by college attainment",
       alpha = "% of hh with known poverty level",
       y = "percent below poverty line",
       x = "percent with college degree") 
```
## Write your own labels with `labs()`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
midwest |>
  ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
             y = percbelowpoverty,
             alpha = percpovertyknown)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "County-level poverty by college attainment",
       alpha = "% of hh with known poverty level",
       y = "percent below poverty line",
       x = "percent with college degree") 
```


# Thinking about how underlying data maps to aesthetics

## discrete vs continuous data

Here discrete and continuous have different meaning than in math

| aes | discrete | continuous |
| --- | -------- | ----------|
| | limited number of classes | unlimited number of values | 
| | i.e. < 10 values | any number of values|
| |usually `chr` or `lgl` | numeric |
|`x`, `y`| yes | yes |
| `color`, `fill` | yes | yes |
| `shape`| yes (6 or fewer) | no |
| `size`, `alpha` | not advised | yes|
| `facet` | yes | not advised |

- If your "discrete" data is numeric, use `as.character()` or `as_factor()` to enforce the decision.


## `color` can be continuous (but default not great) 

```{r}
midwest |>
    ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
               y = percbelowpoverty, 
               color = percpovertyknown)) +
  geom_point() 
```

## `color` can be continuous 

- lots of tools to explore, need to think about what is being communicated

```{r}
midwest |>
    ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
               y = percbelowpoverty, 
               color = percpovertyknown)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_colour_gradientn(colors=c("red", "blue"))
```

## `shape` does not play well with many categories
\footnotesize
- Will only map to 6 categories, the rest become `NA`.
- We can override this behavior and get up to 25 distinct shapes

```{r, warning = FALSE}
# Bad example
midwest |>
    ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
               y = percbelowpoverty, 
               shape = county)) +
  geom_point() + 
  # legend off, otherwise it overwhelms
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

## `alpha` and `size` can be misleading with discrete data

```{r}
# Bad example
midwest |>
    ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
               y = percbelowpoverty, 
               alpha = state)) +
  geom_point()
```

# Thinking about how underlying data maps to type of figure (`geom`)


## Type of figures

1. Distribution of **univariate (single variable)**

  - boxplot, histogram, density plot, etc
  
2. Relationship between **bivariate (two variables)**

  - scatter plot, line plot, boxplot, (segmented) bar plot, etc
  
3. Relationship between **many variables** at once

  - usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others


## Univariate: histogram

```{r, eval = TRUE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege)) +
      geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

## Univariate: density

```{r, eval = TRUE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege)) +
      geom_density()
```


## Univariate: box plots

```{r, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege)) +
      geom_boxplot()
```

## Univariate: bar plot 

Like `geom_histogram()`, `geom_bar()` counts your data.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = state)) +
      geom_bar()
```

## Bivariate: scatter plot

```{r, eval = TRUE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
              y = percbelowpoverty)) +
      geom_point(size=1)
```

## Bivariate: scatter + smooth Line plot

```{r, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
              y = percbelowpoverty)) +
      geom_point(size = 1) +
      geom_smooth()
```

## Bivariate: scatter + smooth Line plot

```{r, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = percollege, 
              y = percbelowpoverty)) +
      geom_point(size = 1) +
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)  # turn off std errors
```

## Bivariate: box plots

```{r, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE}
midwest |>
   ggplot(aes(x = state, 
              y = percollege)) +
      geom_boxplot()
```



## Recap: There are many ways you can visualize your data!

- Visualizations  provide insights into variable relationships

  - Making quick plots helps us understand data and makes us aware of data issues

- `ggplot` starts by mapping data to "aesthetics"

    - e.g. What data shows up on `x` and `y` axes and how `color`, `size` and `shape` appear on the plot
    
- Then, we use `geom`s to create a visualization based on the mapping

- We many consider adding labels to make plots more readable



## Next steps

Labs

- Today: Data visualization with `ggplot` (may run into tomorrow)

**I can produce basic plots to explore and communicate about data**

Lecture

- Data analysis with grouped data




## Appendix: Some graphs you made along the way

- `annual_sales`

- Distributions

- Grouped bar graph

- Faceted bar graph


## Today's data: `annual_sales`

```{r}
annual_sales <- 
  txhousing |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(total_volume = sum(volume, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## Appendix: distributions

- `geom_density()` only requires an `x` aesthetic and it calculates the distribution to plot.
- We can set the aesthetics manually, independent of data for nicer graphs.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
    
    chi_sq_samples <-
     tibble(x = c(rchisq(100000, 2), 
                  rchisq(100000, 3), 
                  rchisq(100000, 4)),
            df = rep(c("2", "3", "4"), each = 1e5)) 
    
    chi_sq_samples |>
      ggplot(aes(x = x, fill = df)) +
      geom_density( alpha = .5) + 
      labs(fill = "df", x = "sample")
```

## Appendix: distributions

```{r,echo = FALSE}
    
    chi_sq_samples <-
     tibble(x = c(rchisq(100000, 1) + rchisq(100000, 1), 
                  rchisq(100000, 3), 
                  rchisq(100000, 4)),
            df = rep(c("2", "3", "4"), each = 1e5)) 
    
    chi_sq_samples |>
      ggplot(aes(x = x, fill = df)) +
      geom_density( alpha = .5) + 
      labs(fill = "df", x = "sample")
```


## Appendix: grouped bar graph

- `position = "dodge2"` tells R to put bars next to each other, rather than stacked on top of each other.
- Notice we use `fill` and not `color` because we're "filling" an area.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
    mean_share_per_country |>
      ggplot(aes(y = country, 
                 x = mean_share, 
                 fill = percentile)) +
      geom_col(position = "dodge2") +
      labs(x = "Mean share of national wealth", 
           y = "", 
           fill = "Wealth\npercentile")
```

## Appendix: grouped bar graph

  ![](./images/10_3.png)

## Appendix: faceted bar graph

- Notice that we manipulate our data to the right specification before making this graph
- Using `facet_wrap` we get a distinct graph for each time period.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
     mean_share_per_country_with_time |>
      ggplot(aes(x = country, 
                 y = mean_share, 
                 fill = percentile)) +
        geom_col(position = "dodge2") + 
        facet_wrap(vars(time_period))
```
