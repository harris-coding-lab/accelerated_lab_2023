# Brainstorm: What types of actions do you need to work with data sets?


## Data manipulation with `dplyr`

The `dplyr` library provides a toolkit for data manipulation.

Today will cover:

- `select()` to pick columns
- `filter()` to get rows that meet a criteria
- `arrange()` to order the data
- `mutate()` to create new columns
- `summarize()` to summarize data


As I show you examples, I'll work with variations of `txhousing` a data set
built-in to `dplyr`


##  `tidyverse` origins: `dplyr` 

![](../resources/images/dplyr_in_tidyverse.png)



## selecting **columns**

![](../resources/images/02_select.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}

## You want to present a subset of your **columns**

```{r}
select(txhousing_short, city, date, sales, listings)
```


## `select()` extends `[, col_expressions]`

```{r}
identical(
  select(txhousing, city, date, sales, listings),
  txhousing[, c("city", "date", "sales", "listings")],
)
```

Compare:

 -`select` can operate with column names while `[` requires characters.
 -`select` doesn't require column names to be in a single vector



## exclude columns with `select()` and `-`

`-` says to exclude the columns listed in the vector.


```{r}
select(txhousing_short, -c(city, date, sales, listings, year))
```

## `tidyverse` provides helpers for pulling out columns


I want a bunch of columns with similar names.

- use `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, `contains()`
- or `matches()` with regular expressions

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# baseR requires more coding knowledge
# txhousing[,grep("^city", names(txhousing))]

select(txhousing_short, ends_with("e"))

```



##  Use case: You want to reorder your columns

- Notice we used a "select_helpers" function `everything()`. 
- See also `dplyr` function `relocate()`


```{r}
select(txhousing_short, 
       year, month, date, everything()) 
```

## select helpers only work with `select()`

You may see this error^[check out `?tidyselect::select_helpers()` and R4DS section on `select()`]

```
`contains()` must be used within a *selecting* function.
See <https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-selection-context.html>.
```


For similar functionality outside of "selecting", see the `stringr` package


## choose **rows** that match a condition

![](../resources/images/02_filter.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}

## choose rows that match a condition with `filter()`

Get all the data from 2013
```{r}
filter(txhousing, year == 2013)
```


##  `filter()` extends `[row_expression, ]`

```{r}
identical(
  filter(txhousing, year == 2013),
  txhousing[txhousing$year == 2013, ]
)
```

Notice that `filter` can operate with column names while `[` requires that you use a vector.


## `filter()` drops comparisons that result in `NA`

Compare:

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, 2, NA))
filter(df, x > 1)
df[df$x > 1, ]
```


##  When you think  `filter()`, think comparison operator!

Recall: Comparison operators return TRUE or FALSE

| Operator | Name |
|:---------:|:---:|
| < | less than |
| > | greater than |
| <= | less than or equal to |
| >= | greater than or equal to |
| == | equal to |
| != | not equal to |
| %in% | matches something in |

We've also seen `is.na()` to test for `NA`.

## What does `%in%` do?

```{r}
x <- c(1, 5, 3)

x %in% 5
x %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```


## `%in%` operator is like a bunch of OR strung together


```{r}
x <- c(1, 5, 3)

identical(
  # too much typing
  x == 1 | x == 2 | x == 3 | x == 4,
  
  x %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4)
)
```


## `%in%` operator is vectorized


Tests *element-by-element* whether items are in the right-side! 


```{r}
x <- c(1, 5, 3)
# 1 %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4)  TRUE
# 5 %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4)  FALSE
# 3 %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4)  FALSE
x %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4) 
```

##  Get all the data from 2013 and beyond for Houston. 

  - in `filter()` additional match criteria are treated like `and`
 
```{r}
  filter(txhousing_narrow, 
         year >= 2013, 
         city == "Houston")
```



## To do the same operation with `[` ... 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
identical(
  filter(txhousing, 
         year >= 2013,
         city == "Houston"),

txhousing[txhousing$year >= 2013 &
                   txhousing$city == "Houston", ]
)
```




## Why do we get 0 rows here?

Get all the data from 2013 and beyond for Houston and Austin

```{r}
  filter(txhousing_narrow,
         year >= 2013, 
         city == "Houston", 
         city == "Austin")
```


## There's no rows where `city` is both Houston AND Austin!

We logically want data from Houston OR Austin

```{r}
  filter(txhousing_narrow,
         year >= 2013, 
         city == "Houston" | city == "Austin")
```

## At some point you will make this mistake!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
  filter(txhousing_narrow,
         year >= 2013, 
         city == "Houston" | "Austin")
```

```
Error in filter(txhousing, year >= 2013, city == "Houston" | : 
Caused by error in `city == "Houston" | "Austin"`:
! operations are possible only for numeric, logical or complex types
```

## What if we want data from Houston, Austin OR Galveston

```{r, eval = FALSE}
  filter(txhousing,
         year >= 2013, 
         city == "Houston" | city == "Austin" | city == "Galveston")
```

There has to be an easier way!

## Use `%in%`!

```{r}
  in_three_cities <- 
    filter(txhousing,
          year >= 2013, 
          city %in% c("Houston", "Dallas", "Austin"))
```


## Why does it fail to produce the same result?

```{r}
eq_three_cities <- 
      filter(txhousing,
             year >= 2013, 
             city == c("Houston", "Dallas", "Austin"))

identical(in_three_cities, eq_three_cities)
nrow(in_three_cities)
nrow(eq_three_cities)
```




## Be wary of vector recycling.

 `==` with vectors of different length is usually a bad idea.

```{r}
ex <- tibble(id = 1:4,
       attribute = c("a", "a", "b", "b"))

ex

filter(ex, attribute == c("a", "c"))
```

## Be wary of vector recycling.

```{r}

# a == a
# a == c
# b == a
# b == c

filter(ex, attribute == c("a", "c"))
```


## Another win for `%in%`

```{r}
# a %in% c(a, c)
# a %in% c(a, c)
# b %in% c(a, c)
# b %in% c(a, c)

filter(ex, attribute %in% c("a", "c"))
```


##  `dplyr` concept:  Data in, Data out


Notice that `filter()` and `select()`

- data in the first position
- `...` in the second position (i.e. allows for arbitrary number of inputs) 
- return data


`dplyr` functions take in a tibble and return a tibble.

- This allows us to chain together data-moves without creating clutter


But how do we chain together functions?

## Introducing the pipe operator

![](../resources/images/magritte.jpg)

## Ceci est une `|>`

The pipe `|>` operator takes the left-hand side and makes it *input* in the right-hand side.

- by default, LHS is *first argument* of the RHS function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# a tibble is the first argument
select(txhousing, city, year, sales, volume) 

txhousing |>
  select(city, year, sales, volume)
```


## Read `|>` as "and then. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Take data
txhousing |>
  # And then select city, year, month and median
  select(city, year, month, median) |>
  # And then filter where year is 2013
  filter(year == 2013) |>
  # And then show the head  (i.e. first 6 rows)
  head()
```



##  Chaining avoids intermediate data frames!

- Coming up with names is hard.
- Updating an object repeatedly leads to a *buggy* development process

```{r}
txhousing |>
  select(city, year, month, median) |>
  filter(year == 2013) |>
  head(3)
```

##  Updating an object repeatedly `->` *buggy* code


```{r, eval=FALSE}
txhousing <- read_csv(...)

# Code in a different chunk
txhousing <- txhousing |>
  mutate(important_new_col =  ..code..)

# Code in yet a different chunk
txhousing <- txhousing |> 
  filter(important_new_col < 10)
```

Error in `filter()`: . . .

! object 'important_new_col' not found

## Treat coding like writing 

- start with a rough draft, but polish as you go.
- put code that defines/manipulates an object close together
  - like writing a tight paragraph
  - the name is the topic sentence

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Sometimes reading data is slow, so I have this habit
txhousing_raw <- read_csv(...)

# Now only reference to with name txhousing
# all in one chunk
txhousing <- txhousing_raw |>
  mutate(important_new_col =  ..code..) |> 
  filter(important_new_col < 10)
```




## `%>%` is also a pipe. 

- `%>%` was the original pipe in R
  
  - in `magrittr` package
  - still loads when with `library(tidyverse)`
    
- `|>` was added to baseR in version 4.1 


`%>%` has more bells and whistles, which can be a liability



## sort rows

![](../resources/images/02_arrange.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}

## sort rows with `arrange()`

```{r}

identical(
  # base R
  txhousing[order(txhousing$year), ],
  
  # dplyr
  arrange(txhousing, year)
)
```

## sort rows with `arrange()`

To sort in `desc()`ending order.

```{r}

identical(
  # base R
  txhousing[order(-txhousing$year), ],
  
  # dplyr
  txhousing %>% arrange(desc(year))
)

```


## sort rows with `arrange()`

- arrange can take multiple columns
<!--Note this is a nice lead into mutate, b/c volume is so hard to read-->

```{r}
txhousing_example %>% 
  arrange(year, month, desc(volume)) %>%
  head()
```


## create columns

![](../resources/images/02_mutate.png){#id .class width=80% height=80%}


## `mutate(.data, ...)` works like other dplyr verbs

```{r}
# the data in the first position 
txhousing_example |>
  # after that ... create columns like so
  mutate( volume_millions = volume / 1e6)  |>
  head()
``` 

## creating columns with `mutate()` 

When we mutate, you can create new columns.

- *Right-hand side*: the name of a new column. 
- *Left-hand side*: code that creates a vector

  - no quotes and no reference to the data's name

```{r}
txhousing_example |>
  mutate(volume_millions = volume / 1e6) |>
  head()
```
  


##  Compare to base R `$ <-`


```{r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(txhousing, 
       volume_millions = volume / 1e6)

txhousing$volume_millions <- 
  txhousing$volume / 1e6
```

- baseR operates on vectors directly, requires assignment `<-`



## `dplyr` functions know that `name`s refer to columns

```{r}
identical(
# BAD: extracting the column (not as nice)  
txhousing_example |>
  mutate(volume_millions = txhousing_example$volume / 1e6),

# GOOD: referring to the column by name!
txhousing_example |>
  mutate(volume_millions = volume / 1e6)
)
```




## `dplyr` verbs allow many updates at once

- with `mutate()`, create multiple columns
- use information from a newly created column 
  - code evaluated in order from top to bottom.

```{r}
txhousing_example |>
  mutate(mean_price = volume / sales,
         sqrt_mean_price = sqrt(mean_price)) %>%
  head()
```


## The change is not permanent

Until you assign the output tibble to a name!

```{r}
texas_housing_again <- 
txhousing_example |>
  mutate(mean_price = volume / sales,
         sqrt_mean_price = sqrt(mean_price))
```


## You try it.
  
If you load `tidyverse`, you can access the `midwest` data 

What dplyr function would you need to ...

- choose the columns `county`, `state`, `poptotal`, `popdensity`
- get the counties with population over a million
- reorder the columns by population total
- round the popdensity to the nearest whole number

## You try it

- `select()` the columns `county`, `state`, `poptotal`, `popdensity`
- `filter()` the counties with population over a million
- `arrange()` the columns by population total
- `mutate()` to round the `popdensity` to the nearest whole number
- AND `mutate()` to round the `population` totals to the nearest 1000

if you finish early: Try to write it in base R

```{r, echo = FALSE}
midwest %>%
  select(county, state, poptotal, popdensity) %>%
  filter(poptotal > 1e6) %>%
  arrange(desc(poptotal)) %>%
  mutate(popdensity = round(popdensity),
         poptotal = round(poptotal, -3)
  # alternatively: 
  #      poptotal = poptotal - poptotal %% 1000
  )

```


## solution



```{r, eval = FALSE}
midwest %>%
  select(county, state, poptotal, popdensity) %>%
  filter(poptotal > 1e6) %>%
  arrange(desc(poptotal)) %>%
  mutate(popdensity = round(popdensity),
         poptotal = poptotal - poptotal %% 1000 
  # alternatively: 
  #     poptotal = round(poptotal, -3)
  )
```


## solution in base R

```{r}
out <- midwest[midwest$poptotal > 1e6, 
        c("county", "state", "poptotal", "popdensity")]

out$popdensity <- round(out$popdensity)
out$poptotal <- out$poptotal - out$poptotal %% 1000 

out[order(out$poptotal, decreasing = TRUE), ]


```


## summarize data with `summarize()`

![](../resources/images/02_summarize.png)

## Calculate total volume of sales in Texas from 2014. 

```{r}
txhousing %>%
  filter(year == 2014) %>%
  summarize(total_volume = sum(volume))
```

```{r}
# take sum of txhousing and subset so year is 2014 and column is volume
sum(txhousing[txhousing$year == 2014,"volume"])

# take the volume column and subset values where year is 2014
sum(txhousing$volume[txhousing$year == 2014])
```



## Calculate the mean and median number of sales in Texas's three largest cities. 

```{r}
txhousing |>
  filter(city %in% 
           c("Houston", "Dallas", "San Antonio")) |>
  summarize(median_n_sales = median(sales),
            mean_n_sales = mean(sales))
```

## summarize data with `summarize()`

There are many useful functions that go with summarize. Try `?summarize` for more.

```{r}
txhousing %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n(),
            n_cities = n_distinct(city))
```

## Alert: `summarize()` without summarizing

Weird behavior: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# in older versions of dplyr this gives an error
# Error: Column `mean_price` must be length 1 (a summary value), not 561

txhousing %>%
  summarize(mean_price = volume / sales) %>%
  head()
```


## piping `dplyr` verbs together
\footnotesize
`dplyr`verbs can be piped together in any order you want, although different orders can give you different results, so be careful!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
txhousing |>
  select(city, year, month, sales, volume) |>
  mutate(log_mean_price = log(volume / sales)) |>
  filter(year == 2013) |>
  summarize(log_mean_price_2013 = mean(log_mean_price,
                                       na.rm = TRUE))
  
# Won't give you the same result as 
# txhousing %>%
#  select(city, year, month, sales, volume) %>%
#  mutate(log_mean_price = log(volume / sales)) %>%
#  summarize(log_mean_price = mean(log_mean_price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
#  filter(year == 2013)
  
# Actually this code will give you an error, try it!

```
## Recap: manipulating data with `dplyr`

We learned

- how to employ the Big 5 `dplyr` verbs

  - `select()` to pick columns
  - `arrange()` to order the data
  - `mutate()` to create new columns
  - `filter()` to get rows that meet a criteria
  - `summarize()` to summarize data

- how to use relation operators, binary operators for math and logical operators in `dplyr` contexts


## Next steps:

Lab: 

- Today lab: practice with `dplyr` verbs (and base R manipulation)
- Tomorrow lab: more practice in data manipulation

**Touchstones: I can comfortably manipulate data^[i.e. adjust or add columns to data, subset it in various ways, sort it as needs be and make summary tables.]**

Next lecture: 

- Using `if` and `ifelse`
- We'll have a completely low stakes quiz to help surmise how we're doing
<!--
## Appendix: creating the example data

```{r}

txhousing_short <- head(txhousing)
txhousing_narrow <- txhousing %>% 
                          select(city, year) %>% 
                          distinct()
txhousing_example <- txhousing %>% 
                          filter(city %in% c("Austin", "Galveston")) %>%
                          select(city, year, month, sales, volume)
```


## creating columns in Base R

We've hinted at how to add columns in base R. 

What would you guess based on how we added values to lists or changed values in vectors?

## creating columns in Base R

1. Refer to a column with `$`.^[or `[[`]
2. Assign a vector to the column name

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# convert the dollar amount to millions
txhousing$volume_millions <- 
  round(txhousing$volume / 1000000, 1)
```


## The change is permanent.

Because we used an assignment operator. 

```{r}
txhousing |>
  select(starts_with("volume")) |>
  head()
```

##  All my x's live in Texas

Vectors of size 1 are recycled.

```{r}
txhousing$state <- "Texas"

txhousing |> select(city, state) |> head()
```



## solution in base R

- You may also see some base R functions that are antecedents to
  dplyr
  
- (comparison of subset and filter on stackoverflow)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39882463/difference-between-subset-and-filter-from-dplyr]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# subset: filters and selects referring to names
out <- subset(midwest, poptotal > 1e6, 
        c(county, state, poptotal, popdensity))


# within: mutate but with unfortunate syntax 
out <- within(out,{
                popdensity <- round(popdensity)
                poptotal <- poptotal - poptotal %% 1000 
              })

out[order(out$poptotal, decreasing = TRUE), ]


```
